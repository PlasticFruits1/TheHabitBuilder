## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft pastel blue (#A7D1AB) to evoke a sense of calmness and growth.
- Background color: Light desaturated pastel green (#E8F5E9). This pale backdrop enhances the hand-drawn style by making the UI look like it's been sketched on high quality paper.
- Accent color: Muted pastel yellow (#F9E79F) to highlight points and unlocked items, adding a touch of happiness.
- Font: 'Belleza' (sans-serif) for headings, and 'Alegreya' (serif) for body. These are a stylish and elegant combination. 'Belleza' works well in small chunks, while 'Alegreya' has the readability needed for longer paragraphs.
- Custom, hand-drawn style icons that visually represent habits and garden items.
- Clean, spacious layout to prioritize clarity, making it easy for users to track habits and navigate the garden.
- Subtle animations, such as garden elements 'growing' or 'sparkling,' to create a satisfying sense of progress.
